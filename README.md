This repository contains a collection of my Mobile Software Development labs completed during my third year of Computer Science at TU Dublin. 

All applications are developed using Kotlin, Java, and XML in Android Studio, showcasing various aspects of mobile app development.

# Lab Summaries

### Lab 1: Hello World App
In this lab, I developed a simple application that displays a personalized message. This project serves as an introduction to Android development, showcasing basic UI elements and text display.

### Lab 2: Vertical Linear Layout
In this lab, I created an example project that demonstrates the use of vertical linear layouts in Android. The application features buttons arranged in a column, effectively illustrating how to structure UI components within a mobile application.

### Lab 3: UI Component Interactions
In this lab, I explored various UI components and their interactions using Kotlin:

- **TextView Manipulation**: Created a layout with a `TextView` displaying "Hello World!" and manipulated its text programmatically.
- **Button View**: Implemented a `Button` that counts and displays user clicks, demonstrating event handling.
- **EditText**: Added `EditText` components to facilitate user input, enabling dynamic text interactions.
- **RadioButton and Spinner**: Incorporated `RadioButtons` and a `Spinner` to enhance user selection options.

### Lab 4: ActionBar, SnackBar, and Calendar Implementation
In this lab, I focused on enhancing the user interface and experience in an Android app by implementing the ActionBar, SnackBar, and calendar feature:

- **ActionBar and Menus**: Utilized the ActionBar at the top of the activity to create a consistent navigation experience. This involved implementing an options menu with actions, such as adding a new item, and managing user selections effectively.
- **Event Handling**: Developed Kotlin code to handle events triggered by user interactions with the ActionBar, ensuring responsive app behavior.
- **SnackBar Introduction**: Integrated the SnackBar component to provide brief feedback messages at the bottom of the screen. I implemented two scenarios: one that displays a simple message and another that includes an action (e.g., "Undo").
- **Calendar Feature**: Added functionality for users to select a date via a calendar interface. Upon selection, a message is displayed showing the chosen date, enhancing user interactivity with a visual confirmation of their selection.
- **Demonstration**: Successfully executed the app to showcase the functionality of the ActionBar, SnackBar, and calendar feature, emphasizing their roles in enhancing user engagement and providing meaningful feedback.

### Lab 5: Dialogs and Orientation Handling
In this lab, I implemented various types of dialogs and event handling in an Android application:

- **Alert Dialogs**: Created dialogs to inform users and prompt simple choices, effectively managing user confirmations and notifications.
- **List Dialogs**: Developed a List Dialog that allows users to select from a predefined set of options, enhancing interaction through a clear selection interface.
- **Input Dialogs**: Designed custom input dialogs to gather user data, allowing for personalized input fields and layouts tailored to the app's needs.
- **Event Handling**: For each dialog type, I set up specific event listeners to handle user interactions seamlessly. The alert dialogs provide simple responses, while the list and input dialogs capture user selections and input effectively.

**Screen Orientation Handling**: I also focused on managing orientation changes by creating separate layout files for both portrait and landscape modes. This involved:

- **Defining Alternate Layouts**: Created a new layout resource specifically for landscape mode to ensure that the UI remains user-friendly and visually appealing regardless of the device's orientation.
- **Layout Management**: Implemented the logic to switch between these layouts automatically when the device orientation changes, ensuring a smooth user experience.

### Lab 6: Building a Reactive App with Architecture Components
In this lab, I built an app using Androidâ€™s Architecture Components: Room, ViewModel, and LiveData. The app focused on managing a list of words with a local database and updating the UI reactively when data changes.

- **Room Database**: I integrated Room to save and retrieve words, and pre-populated the database with sample data.
- **RecyclerView**: The app displayed words in a RecyclerView, automatically updating the list when the database changed.
- **Adding Data**: I implemented a FloatingActionButton that opened a second activity, allowing users to enter and add new words to the database.
- **ViewModel & LiveData**: The ViewModel exposed data through LiveData, ensuring the UI updated automatically when the data in the database changed.
- **Repository & DAO**: I used the Repository to manage data operations, while the DAO provided methods for querying the database.

By the end of this lab, I built an app with a clean architecture, utilizing LiveData to create a reactive UI that updates seamlessly in response to changes in the Room database. This lab helped me understand how to structure apps using architecture components for better scalability and maintainability.
